      This folder is primarily used for managing migration files, which are essential for database schema changes. 
      Due to the nature of these files, it is less likely that security issues should arise from this folder. 
      However, it is still important to ensure that any scripts or configurations within are reviewed for best practices 
      to maintain overall application security.
