      This folder, sqli.utils, is primarily focused on managing authentication processes. The policies within are designed
      to scan and ensure the security of authentication mechanisms, identifying vulnerabilities such as improper session
      management, weak password policies, and inadequate protection of authentication tokens.
    excludes:
      - "migrations"
      - "config"
  - type: "false_positive"
    description: >
      In the context of the sqli.utils folder, false positives can arise from overly aggressive detection of SQL injection
      patterns. It is essential to refine detection algorithms to differentiate between actual vulnerabilities and benign
      code patterns. This involves enhancing the accuracy of pattern matching and incorporating contextual analysis to
      reduce unnecessary alerts, ensuring that only genuine threats are flagged.

      This policy is designed to address and remediate vulnerabilities identified in the application, particularly focusing
      on ensuring secure coding practices. It includes measures to validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL Injection
      and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Additionally, it enforces secure session management practices, such as setting
      secure and HttpOnly flags on cookies, and implementing proper session expiration. The policy also emphasizes the importance
      of using parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection and ensuring that all sensitive data is encrypted both in transit
      and at rest.
